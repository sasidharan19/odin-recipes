    <h2> This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</h2>
    <p> Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>
    <p> The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with béchamel and meat sauce, is well known. The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. The lasagna you eat depends on where you are. </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 15 oz. ricotta cheese (2 cups) </li>
        <li> 1 large egg </li>
        <li> 2 cups mozzarella cheese </li>
        <li> ¾ cup Parmesan cheese (freshly grated) </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning </li>
    </ul>

        <h3> Easy Lasagna Recipe </h3>
        <p> I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

            This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
            
            This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.  </p>
        
        <h3> How to Make It </h3>
        <p> Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake at 375° for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. Broil at the end if desired. Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with Garlic Bread With Cheese.</p>

        <h3> How Many Layers Does Lasagna Have </h3>
        <p> Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.
            I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish. </p>

        <h3> Make Ahead Method </h3>
        <p> Assemble as outlined but do not bake. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
            Thaw frozen lasagna completely before baking.
            Let chilled lasagna sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to baking. Add an additional 10 minutes to covered baking time. </p>

        <h3> Reheating Lasagna </h3>
        <p> To reheat leftover lasagna: Place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes. </p>

        <h3> Storage </h3>
        <p> Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Leftovers do freeze well. </p>
